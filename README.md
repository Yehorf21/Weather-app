Good day,

I've made a design for this task using Figma and further expanded it while developing.

I didn't finish everything that I planned as I started working on the project the day before the deadline (my fault), but I'd like to stress that I wanted to add:

1. a search bar for city lookup
2. API fetching and usage (have the base for it, but didn't have to enough time to utilize it)
3. update mechanic

What I do have tho is a fully functional mockup website for a weather app.
If I spent another day, I could add any other missing features, animations, sounds for weather states, and more.

I hope this shortcoming won't cut me the chance of working with your team, as I'm fully motivated to help you deliver efficient and quick solutions to your customers.

I could spend a few pages explaining every decision that was made here for better output, but hopefully I'll get the chance to do so at the interview.

Have a nice day, here's the [DEMO](https://weatherlyo.netlify.app/), and hope to work with you.
